# Unitrade Security Guide

## 🔒 Current Security Implementation

### ✅ What's Protected:
1. **Firebase Security Rules** - Control data access
2. **User Authentication** - Only logged-in users can write
3. **Twilio Credentials** - Hidden in backend server
4. **User Data** - Users can only access their own data

### 🔑 Firebase API Keys (Public by Design):
- **apiKey**: `AIzaSyBzyKtEKbUMt66t9Sfk_onbOcJNic_t5oc`
- **projectId**: `unitrade-d74e9`
- **authDomain**: `unitrade-d74e9.firebaseapp.com`

**These are SUPPOSED to be public** - Google designed Firebase this way.

## 🛡️ Security Layers:

### 1. Firebase Security Rules (Primary Protection)
```javascript
// Items: Anyone can read, only authenticated users can write
match /items/{itemId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}

// Users: Only access own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### 2. Authentication Required
- Users must be logged in to post items
- Users must be logged in to place orders
- Users can only see their own orders/notifications

### 3. Backend Protection
- Twilio credentials are in backend server (not exposed)
- WhatsApp notifications go through secure API

## 🚨 What Would Be Dangerous (But We're NOT Doing):
- Putting Twilio credentials in frontend code
- Allowing anyone to write to any collection
- Not having authentication
- Exposing database admin credentials

## ✅ What We ARE Doing (Secure):
- Public Firebase API keys (standard practice)
- Protected Twilio credentials in backend
- Proper Firebase Security Rules
- User authentication for all writes
- Data isolation per user
