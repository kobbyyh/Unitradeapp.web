# Security Fix - Email Verification Required

## ðŸ”’ **Issue Fixed: Unverified Users Could Access Dashboard**

**Problem**: Users could access the dashboard even without verifying their email address.

**Solution**: Added email verification checks at multiple points in the authentication flow.

## âœ… **What's Fixed:**

### **1. Login Process**
- **Before**: Users could login and access dashboard without email verification
- **After**: Users must verify email before accessing dashboard

### **2. Dashboard Access**
- **Before**: Dashboards loaded for any authenticated user
- **After**: Dashboards check email verification status before loading

### **3. Direct URL Access**
- **Before**: Users could directly access dashboard URLs
- **After**: Direct access redirects to email verification page

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works Now:**

### **Complete User Flow:**
1. **User signs up** â†’ Firebase creates account
2. **Firebase sends verification email** â†’ User receives email
3. **User tries to login** â†’ **BLOCKED** until email verified
4. **User clicks verification link** â†’ Email gets verified
5. **User can now login** â†’ Access dashboard

### **Security Checks Added:**

#### **Login Forms:**
```javascript
// Check if email is verified before dashboard access
if (!user.emailVerified) {
    alert('Please verify your email before accessing the dashboard.');
    window.location.href = 'email-verification.html';
    return;
}
```

#### **Dashboard Pages:**
```javascript
// Check email verification on page load
if (!user.emailVerified) {
    alert('Please verify your email before accessing the dashboard.');
    window.location.href = 'email-verification.html';
    return;
}
```
