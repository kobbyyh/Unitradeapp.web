## üîß Demo Features

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ University dropdown with email domain suggestions
- ‚úÖ Form validation and error messages
- ‚úÖ User registration and login
- ‚úÖ **Real email verification with working links**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard access control
- ‚úÖ User type detection (buyer/seller)
- ‚úÖ Logout functionality
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ **Proper favicon and logos throughout**

### What's Simulated:
- üîÑ Email sending (shows verification link in alert)
- üîÑ Product data (shows sample products)
- üîÑ User authentication (uses localStorage)
- üîÑ Database operations (simulated with alerts)

## üöÄ Production Setup

To use with real Firebase:

1. **Replace Demo Code**: Replace all localStorage-based authentication with actual Firebase calls
2. **Update Firebase Config**: Replace placeholder config with your actual Firebase project details
3. **Set up Firestore**: Create the required collections and security rules
4. **Enable Authentication**: Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console

## üì± Cross-Platform Testing

The web platform is designed to work alongside your Flutter app:

1. **Same Data Structure**: User data format matches your Flutter app
2. **University Integration**: Uses same university list as your app
3. **User Types**: Supports both buyer and seller accounts
4. **Authentication Flow**: Similar signup/login process

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"No account found"**: Make sure to sign up first before trying to login
2. **JavaScript errors**: Check browser console for any errors
3. **Redirect loops**: Clear localStorage and try again
4. **Form not submitting**: Check that all required fields are filled

### Clear Demo Data:
```javascript
// Run in browser console to clear all demo data
localStorage.clear();
```
