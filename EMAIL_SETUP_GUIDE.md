# Email Notification Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What's Changed**

âœ… **Removed Node.js backend** - No more complex server setup needed
âœ… **Removed in-app notifications** - Sellers no longer need to check the app
âœ… **Added email notifications** - Sellers get instant email notifications
âœ… **Simplified architecture** - Everything works with Firebase + EmailJS

## ðŸ“§ **How It Works Now**

### **When a Buyer Places an Order:**
1. **Order is saved** to Firebase
2. **System gets seller's email** from their profile
3. **Email is sent automatically** to the seller with:
   - Order details (product, price, quantity)
   - Buyer's contact information (name, phone, location)
   - Order ID and date
4. **Seller receives email** instantly and can contact the buyer directly

## ðŸš€ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set up EmailJS**
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Follow the setup guide in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md`

### **Step 2: Configure Email Service**
1. Open `js/email-service.js`
2. Replace these values with your EmailJS credentials:
   - `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - `YOUR_SERVICE_ID`
   - `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID`

### **Step 3: Test the System**
1. Open `email-test.html` in your browser
2. Send a test email to verify everything works
3. Check your email inbox
